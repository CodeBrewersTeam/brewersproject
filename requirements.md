# Software Requirements::RoomEase

## Vision

We are creating a web app that functions as an organizational tool for a household of roommates.

Keeps room mates on top of cleaning and shared bills.

You should care because to do otherwise would be hurtful. Also because many roommates are ... negligent to their share of household responsibilities. 

## Scope (In/Out)


**Out of Scope**
* This app doesn't act as a payment portal
* This app will only be developed with Java & Postgres as a web app
* This app will also not be collecting discrete demographic data

**Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Definition**: The MVP of RoomEase will include the following core features:
* User Registration and Profile Creation: Allow users to sign up and create their profiles, including basic information and roommate preferences.
* Chore Management: Provide a feature for roommates to create and assign chores, set due dates, and mark tasks as completed.
* Shared To-Do Lists: Enable roommates to create collaborative to-do lists for tasks like grocery shopping, apartment maintenance, or event planning.


**STRETCH GOALS**:
* In or Out Status
* Expense Tracking: Offer a simple way for roommates to input and track shared expenses, view payment history, and calculate each person's contribution.
* Dashboard and Notifications: Design a user-friendly dashboard where roommates can see all pending chores, bills, and notifications in one place.
* Roommate Communication: Implement a messaging system to enable roommates to chat, share important updates, and discuss any issues related to their living arrangement.
